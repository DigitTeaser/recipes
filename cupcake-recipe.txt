Ingredients:
 - 3/4 cup unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder
 - 3 cups all-purpose flour
 - 1 teaspoon baking powder
 - 1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter
 - 4 large eggs, room temperature
 - 1 cup sour cream, room temperature
 - 3/4 cup hot water
 - 1 teaspoon baking soda
 - 1 1/4 teaspoons coarse salt
 - 2 1/4 cups sugar
 - 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
 - Chocolate Ganache Frosting

Directions:
 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line standard muffin tins with paper liners. 
    Whisk together cocoa and hot water until smooth. In another bowl, whisk 
    together flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
 
 2. Melt butter with sugar in a saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring to 
    combine. Remove from heat, and pour into a mixing bowl. With an electric 
    mixer on medium-low speed, beat until mixture is cooled, 4 to 5 minutes. 
    Add eggs, one at a time, beating until each is incorporated, scraping down 
    sides of bowl as needed. Add vanilla, then cocoa mixture, and beat until 
    combined. Reduce speed to low. Add flour mixture in two batches, alternating 
    with the sour cream, and beating until just combined after each.
 3. Divide batter evenly among lined cups, filling each three- quarters full. 
    Bake, rotating tins halfway through, until a cake tester inserted in centers 
    comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Transfer tins to wire racks to cool 15 
    minutes; turn out cupcakes onto racks and let cool completely. Cupcakes can 
    be stored overnight at room temperature, or frozen up to 2 months, in airtight 
    containers.
 4. To finish, use a small offset spatula to spread cupcakes with frosting.
